Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT) code is 
/usr/local/nanograv-pipeline
(Apache OODT integrates and archives your processes, your data, and its metadata)


The User Interface (UI) code is in
/usr/local/www/nano
Directory:  "app" is the broad application itself
Subdirectory "partials" are things that do individual pages
See analysis.htm for  
all the stuff we're doing is under analysis.html
you can see the html branch
For example search for "Step 1" and you'll see where that button is named.
"accordions" are the things that expand into a bunch of options when you click on them
Search for "accordion-heading" and you'll see the titles of the accordions
Comments are enclosed in <!--   --> (and it appears in blue in vi)   

"Step 2" Perform analysis
"Engage" buttons are here.

There is a class of scripts that end in "js" (java script)
controllers.js   has something that handles your request (called a handler)
you can see the defaults in line 8 in controller.js

processAnalysisForm runs the residual code

http.get calls - calls the background api (application programming interface) 
(there are a series of "get" calls)

If you run the bridge locally you can look at processes like these:
local:5000/api/get/os/14248

When you are on the bridge you
can right click and inspect element
the api knows where to grab all this data from and spits it back out
you can watch it call thing "get" when you click "engage" on the web page

select optimal analysis
in the consol it calls another analysis and gives it the sessionID

nanograv-pipeline/logs
Contains the OODT logs.  If you run into an error it's useful to look here.
Nate now knows how to look at these.
